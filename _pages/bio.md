Hello all! I'm Robin.

I'm passionate about VR/AR, high tech and how cutting edge technology can make a difference in business, education, art, and human connection.

I love coding, making anything more efficient, cheering on others' successes, talking about goals, travelling, and overcoming new challenges.

In my off-time, I'm outside running, hiking, lifting weights, focusing on a passion project (currently learning Chinese), playing art and story video/VR games, petting the neighborhood cats, and joking about petting the neighborhood cats.
