Data-VR was an exploration in data visualizations in virtual reality, built in 3 weeks on a team with Daniel Ong and Jing Jia.

Our traditional first approach took real datasets in .csv format and translated the datapoints into VR coordinates. We have scatterplot and barchart functionality.

The second project bitcoin-vr (called blockchain-vr at the time), abstracted real-time Bitcoin transactions into an experience.
