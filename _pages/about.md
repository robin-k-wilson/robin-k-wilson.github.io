Hello! I'm Robin! I'm a full stack web developer with specialties in JavaScript, React, React-VR, and Node.js. My passion projects utilize React-VR and A-Frame to explore Virtual Reality for the web.

Welcome to my personal website that showcases my past tech projects and my coding experience.

After three years of leaning on my Business degree in various roles such as business consultant, VR demo specialist, and coordinator for the Oculus demos at Facebook HQ, I decided to pursue tech and become a full-time software developer as a career. To get that kickstarted, I attended Fullstack Academy's remote immersive program, that threw me into coding full time. Even with a CS degree, the program was incredibly challenging and I got to experience collaborating across the country and the world.

I enjoy learning new skills, travelling, taking on challenges, art, cooking, hiking, and making anything new.
