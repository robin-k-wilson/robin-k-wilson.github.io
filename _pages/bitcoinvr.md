A real-time Bitcoin visualization, every Bitcoin transaction made around the world displays as a hot-air balloon or zeppelin.

Check out the deployed version: [bitcoin-vr.github.io](https://bitcoin-vr.github.io/)

A labor of love, Daniel Ong and I are continuing to improve Bitcoin-VR even after [Data-VR](/datavr/) project concluded.

<h3>Launch December 12, 2017</h3>
We publicized the project on a number of tech news websites for application improvement advice and were happy to recieve a lot of feedback.

We were astounded by the interest in our project, generating 1.8K visitors on the first day and over 11.0K on the second!

We are integrating improvements suggested by the community such as restructuring the redux store to preserve reducer purity and investigating improvements for performance across browsers.
