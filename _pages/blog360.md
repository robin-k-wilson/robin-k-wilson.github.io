Blog 360 was built in 3 days on a solo hackathon project. I explore what the web looks like in virtual reality, a topic I've been looking to explore for a long time.

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

Short 4 minute presentation of the navigation, UI, and fun 360 content.

{% include video id="j5AH63jVYcY" provider="youtube" %}

<h2>Future Expansion</h2>

1. Refactor
2. Integrate a redux store
3. Add back-end for storing blog posts
4. Create 2D interface for other people to create their own content
5. Plug this into large blog websites

<h2>Challenges and Take-Aways</h2>

Overall building this application was a fantastic experience. Being able to create a navigatable product in no time was gratifying. Next time, I would plan out the structure of the React-VR components once I hammer down the general UX. So it's easier to integrate additional content.
