  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p>I build web applications using JavaScript web technologies. My passion projects incorporate VR/AR, blockchain, and automations. I solve technical challenges and strive for the most efficient solution.</p>

  <p>I have the theory and experience of a CS Major and the practical coding skills, drive, and fast prototyping abilities of a coding bootcamp graduate. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science, a BA in Business Leadership, and a minor in Studio Art. After 3 years in business roles automating my jobs to work more efficiently, I decided to pursue coding as a full-time career with affirmation that I have the technical mindset, drive to learn, and tenacity to never give up that a coder needs to succeed.</p>

  <p>When I'm not utilizing the passion and drive of a 26-year-old cracking into software development as a career, I'm outside hiking, running, reading, petting the neighborhood cats, and joking about petting the neighborhood cats.</p>
